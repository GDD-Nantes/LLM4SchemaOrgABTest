        "description": "Pork shoulder steaks come in a couple of varieties. There are shoulder arm steaks and shoulder blade steaks. I believe these are shoulder blade steaks, or close to it. These steaks were simply labeled \"shoulder steaks,\" so who really knows. The pig came from my brother's farm in Pipestone, MN. It was free-range, happy, healthy, and well cared for, which is how I want my meat to be raised. Don't you?\r\n\r\nWhen my brother and I were in college, we lived together for a few years. We didn't have very much money; we lived on a few hundred dollars a month. Naturally, we ate a lot of Ramen, mac n' cheese, and frozen pizza. Once in a while we would \"live it up\" and buy some clearance pork shoulder steaks. You know, from the discounted meat section. We pan fried the steaks with some Cajun seasoning and wolfed them down. We were most likely protein starved. These days we know better than to eat meat from the clearance section. I also haven't had \"Cajun seasoning\" in a very long time. Luckily, my future held no place for MSG-laden, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D4QTW12/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hotogerioft09-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07D4QTW12&amp;linkId=8e4686f68e900628542cf5d12e276cbf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dollar store spice mixes</a>.",
