## Some useful information about Tracy California \- wikipedia

Until the 1760s, the area that is now the city of Tracy was long populated by
the Yokuts ethnic group of loosely associated bands of Native Americans and
their ancestors. They lived on hunting and gathering foods, game and fish from
the area, including its local rivers and creeks. After encountering the
Spanish colonists, the Yokuts suffered from new infectious diseases, which
caused social disruption, as did the Spanish efforts to impress them for labor
at missions, specifically Mission San Jose. Mexican and American explorers
later came into the area, pushing the Yokuts out. The Yokuts people are still
around to this day and live in small groups with a total of about 2,600 people
identifying under the Yokuts name. Along with the Yokuts, another language
group of Native Americans found near the Tracy area are referred to as the
Mono. Today the Mono peoples numbers are around 1,800 people.

Tracy is a railroad town that came from the mid-19th century construction,
mainly by Chinese laborers, of Central Pacific Railroad rail lines running
from Sacramento through Stockton to the San Francisco Bay Area, beginning 1868
and ending September 1878 with the opening of a new branch and junction. A
number of small communities sprang up along these lines at designated station
sites, including one at the junction named for railroad director J. J. Tracy.
