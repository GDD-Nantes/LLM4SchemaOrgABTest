And if it\u2019s not shut after the fire is out, cold downdrafts will come swooping down into your home.  But when your damper stops working and no longer effectively does its job, we can help. Sometimes problems are major, sometimes they\u2019re minor. But whether you simply need a pin replaced or it\u2019s time to consider a new damper, English Sweep, Inc. has your back.",
