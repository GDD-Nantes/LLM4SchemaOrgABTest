    "description": "The Industrial Suction Cup is a simple heavy duty product designed to stop animals from jumping out of the bath during bathing. Simply attach the cup to the inside of the bath or surrounding wall tiles, and then attach a lead or noose to the dog's collar. No tools are required to attach this suction cup, and it is easy to remove after use.",
