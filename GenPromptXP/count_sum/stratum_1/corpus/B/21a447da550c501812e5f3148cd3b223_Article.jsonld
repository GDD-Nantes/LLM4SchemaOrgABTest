    "articleBody": "Museums across the world \u2014 along with artists everywhere \u2014 have had a rough 12 months, from the Louvre in Paris to the Hamburger Kunstalle in Hamburg to the Washington National Gallery.\n\nIn the US, many states have reopened their economies and then closed them again several times over the last year. Many Americans continued to gather in large groups, especially on beaches or other outdoor places.\n\nBut for the most part, America\u2019s museums have been permanently closed since the pandemic began in March 2020. They\u2019ve turned to social media outreach and building their digital collections, even as they were forced to layoff staff and bar all physical visitors.\n\nAs America vaccinates its population and reopens its economy, we should all take a moment to support the institutions that preserve some of the most incredible accomplishments in human history.\n\nThat could be a financial donation, or it could simply be sharing content on social media celebrating these places and the art they protect for all of us.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think Bank of America\u2019s decision to support the best museums in the country is both timely and important. The company has launched a video series called #BofAMasterpieceMoment, providing a platform to the best curators in the country at the best museums in the country, and asking them to simply talk about some of their favorite works of art.\n\nThese are brilliant people speaking passionately about art directly to us \u2014 the people who haven\u2019t been able to go to these places for more than a year. It\u2019s an incredible initiative, and more than worth a little of our time.\n\nThere are so many gems here.\n\nThere\u2019s Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of The Studio Museum in Harlem discussing the jazz-inspired masterpiece \u201cTrane,\u201d a nine-and-a-half-foot-tall surrealist painting by William T. Williams.\n\nHere at the Art Institute of Chicago, we have James Rondeau, President and Eloise W. Martin Director, discussing the timeless masterpiece by Georges Seurat, \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte \u2013 1884.\u201d It was called a \u201cscandal\u201d at its debut before eventually becoming one of the most important and widely recognized paintings of the 19th Century.\n\nOr you can get an insider\u2019s understanding of Joan Mitchell\u2019s gorgeous abstract painting \u201cLow Water\u201d from Eric Crosby, the Henry J. Heinz II director at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.\n\nA new episode of Bank of America\u2019s Masterpiece Moment will be available every two weeks throughout the year. Click here to receive Twitter notifications every time a new video is released.\n\nIf you love art or even if you just want to spend a few minutes feeling like you\u2019re in the tranquil space of a museum, these videos scratch that itch.\n\nI know that this is tough time for many of us. We\u2019re looking for work, or looking for more work, or trying to buy a house in a competitive market. There are so many reasons to do something that seems more practical than spending time with art.\n\nI get that. But I also know that few things connect us to ourselves and to the arc of human history like the experience of great art.\n\nLike going to the park or finishing a good book, these experiences \u2014 even from a distance \u2014 are more than a distraction. The take us outside of our daily problems, if just for a moment, and allow us to feel a little more free, a little more connected to the universal struggle.\n\nI find comfort in that, and I hope you can find it, too.\n\nAnd if you feel inspired by these paintings the way that I do, then I urge you to support your local museum with a donation. The arts need us, and for the sake of our children\u2019s children, they deserve our support.",
