    "articleBody": "The Oregon Ducks finished the season ranked #2 in every poll, the highest finish in school history. After Nebraska\u2019s lackluster performance in the national championship game in an embarrassing loss to Miami in the Rose Bowl, many pundits agreed that it SHOULD have been Oregon in the big game not the Cornhuskers. In the time since, Oregon has expanded Autzen Stadium, built other facilities, earned national respect, and participated in a post-season bowl game all but one year (2004). During that stretch, the Ducks have gone 3-6 in bowls, but that includes three BCS games including the national championship, and are coming off a victory in the Rose Bowl over Wisconsin 45-38, Oregon\u2019s first Rose Bowl victory since 1917.",

This article features an interview with Justin Phinisee, providing insights into the post-game reactions and the impact of the victory on the Oregon football program.",
