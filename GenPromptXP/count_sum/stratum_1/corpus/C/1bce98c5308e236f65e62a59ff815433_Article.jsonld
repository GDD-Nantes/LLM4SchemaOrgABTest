	"description": "The 2002 Fiesta Bowl, a 38-16 victory by Oregon over Colorado, was a landmark moment in many respects. It was the culmination of years of effort from coaches, players, administrators, and the mighty marketing machine of Nike. Before the 2001 season and Oregonâ€™s BCS game victory over Colorado, the Ducks were known on a national level as simply that kooky school out west with the crazy uniforms. After the game, the Ducks were considered a legitimate football program capable of competing toe-to-toe with any school in the nation.",
